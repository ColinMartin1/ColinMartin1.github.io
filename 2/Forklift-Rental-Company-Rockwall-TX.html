<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit.

Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
