Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism.

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
