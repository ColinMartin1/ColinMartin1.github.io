Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Included in each TowPro Air Kit from Ridetech will be 2 Rear exact-fit shock absorbers. High-lift rider trucks shall be fitted with an overhead guard unless the customer otherwise requests. This is important because Ahern has one of the broadest selections of forklifts available on the market.
