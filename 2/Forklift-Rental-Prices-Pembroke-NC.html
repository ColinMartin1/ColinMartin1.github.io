<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks.

The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
