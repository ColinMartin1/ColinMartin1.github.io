We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>

The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
