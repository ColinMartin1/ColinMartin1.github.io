The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>

<p>It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle.

We also provide safety training classes that meet OSHA guidelines for forklift operation. With this new generation of straight-mast forklifts, there are plenty of options to choose from.

<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
