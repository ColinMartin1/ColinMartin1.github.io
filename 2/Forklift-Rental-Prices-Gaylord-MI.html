Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want.

Because of an intelligent man-machine interface, these versatile trucks offer enhanced visibility, acceleration and lift control, all of which are simple to programme. The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions. For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design.
