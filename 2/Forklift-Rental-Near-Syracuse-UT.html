Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two.
