Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability.

<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck.

<h2>Hand Pallet Truck Sandpoint</h2>

Lifting loads became an easier process, and the addition of a crane helped workers to pack forklifts quickly. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.
