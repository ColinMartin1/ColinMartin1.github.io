<p>The 2020 Chevy Silverado 1500 also has a pair of dedicated off-road trims available: the LT Trail Boss and the Custom Trail Boss. Larger tires and wheels have much more mass that will need stronger and larger brakes in order to allow the vehicle to safely come to a complete stop. 7. 7 Powered Industrial Truck - Definition A mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier materials.</p>
