<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
