<p>Counterbalance forklifts are most commonly used indoors in settings such as warehouses and retail spaces.

<p>Also, rough terrain forklifts are designed to last. Sudden malfunctions, seasonal fluctuations or an unexpected large-scale order: Remain flexible and rent exactly the forklift trucks you need at the time.
