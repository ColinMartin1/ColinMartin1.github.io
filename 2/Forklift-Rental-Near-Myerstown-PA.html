The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Engine power is often a critical component of buying a rough terrain forklift. The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles.
