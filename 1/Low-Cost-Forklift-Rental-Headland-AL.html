<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck.
