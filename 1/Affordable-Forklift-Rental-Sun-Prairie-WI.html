<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Discover our range of electric forklifts: designed for different purposes, all with the same world class ergonomics. Rough Terrain lifts are usually powered by internal combustion engines that require refueling. Our machines are tough and will get the job done, but be sure to check out our other used 4-wheel forklifts for sale if you're looking for more options.</p>
