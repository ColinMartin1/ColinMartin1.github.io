Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products. Novice training - This is for those who have no prior knowledge operating forklift trucks. To make sure that this is met even in confined spaces, Linde designed the reach trucks for optimum visibility and fitted them with appropriate equipment.</p>
