<h2>Forklift Training Ideas to Consider for New Forklift Operators Novato </h2>
<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity. Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
