<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions. Lift trucks use either gasoline-powered engines, diesel engines, or electric motors, with the power supplied by a rechargable industrial battery.</p>

<h2>Lifted Trucks For Sale Haslett</h2>

Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks are used to lift and transport pallets (loaded or empty) from one area to another in industrial settings.
