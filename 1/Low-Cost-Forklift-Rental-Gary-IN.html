<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support.

I charge $175 per person, but similar programs can range anywhere from $150 to $600 per person.</p>
