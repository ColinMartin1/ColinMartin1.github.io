<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need.

Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
