<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>
<h2>Pallet Jacks Move Heavy Objects Manlius </h2>
<p>Nido Machineries Pvt Ltd, CUMI MHE, Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Linde Material Handling, PalleTrucks-Trolleys, Jost's Engineering Company Limited, Toyota Material Handling Europe AB, PTB Special Product, Jungheinrich AG, and Crown Equipment Corporation are some key manufacturers operating in the global pallet truck market. Forklift rentals are not inexpensive.</p>
<p>The 2017 sales numbers of 253,146 exceeded most industry expectations,” said Feehan, who noted the continued expansion of e-commerce and advancements in technology coupled with solid U.S. and global economic performance as contributing factors to growth. Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks. A electric forklift (also called lift truck, jitney, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances.</p>
<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets. For many people, the I'm on top of the world” feeling that comes with driving a lifted truck is enough to warrant buying one.</p>
<p>While they may look like cars, forklifts drive differently being that they utilize rear-wheel steering, which helps maneuverability in tight quarters.

<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort. The occurrence of a major rollover accident is increased because lifted trucks have beefier suspensions that require greater travel than a more modest truck or one that is not lifted at all.</p>
