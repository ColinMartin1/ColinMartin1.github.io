You must consider whether the forklift will be working indoors or outdoors, whether it will work on smooth floors or rough terrain and what lift heights and types of product or materials will be involved. Optimum performanceWe are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Hand Pallet Hydraulic Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.
