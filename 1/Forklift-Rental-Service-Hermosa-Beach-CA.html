<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for. It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
