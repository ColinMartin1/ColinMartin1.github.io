<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Discover our range of electric forklifts: designed for different purposes, all with the same world class ergonomics. Rough Terrain lifts are usually powered by internal combustion engines that require refueling. Our machines are tough and will get the job done, but be sure to check out our other used 4-wheel forklifts for sale if you're looking for more options.</p>
<h2>Pallet Lift Equipment Angleton </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation. Renting equipment provides a fixed monthly cost that can be written off as an operating expense, allowing you to stabilize your operating budget.</p>

<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself. Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks.
