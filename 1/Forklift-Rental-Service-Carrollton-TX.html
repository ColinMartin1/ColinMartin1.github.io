Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>The configurable Raymond 4750 4-Wheel Sit-Down Counterbalanced Forklift, well-known for its operator-friendly, open-mast‚Äù visibility, industry-leading ergonomics, and superior maintainability offers new features focused on better productivity, lower long-time costs, and enhanced driver comfort. Forklifts have entirely transformed the storage and shipping industries.</p>

The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
