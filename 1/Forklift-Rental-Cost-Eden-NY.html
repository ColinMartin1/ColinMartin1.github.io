Forklift rental and lease companies may have used forklifts for sale. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
