An overloaded pallet jack is likely to break down and can pose a serious safety hazard for its operators.

Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift.
