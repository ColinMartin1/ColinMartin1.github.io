Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load.
