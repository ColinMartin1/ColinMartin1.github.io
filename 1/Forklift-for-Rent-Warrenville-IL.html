<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy.

Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>

As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs.
