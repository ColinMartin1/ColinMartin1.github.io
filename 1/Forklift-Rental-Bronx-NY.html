<h3>The Benefits of Renting Forklifts in and Other Material Handling Equipment Bronx NY 10467</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>Sideloaders are trucks that operate by picking up their load from the side and travel parallel to the length of the load, from the perspective of the operator. An electronic narrow aisle forklift with an operator platform costs roughly $25,000 to $30,000. Ideal for lifting pallets and heavy loads, stacking in warehouses, loading and unloading trucks.
