Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
